In this practice, you can learn how to train a RNN model and test it on sentiment analysis problem.
## Dataset
* The dataset consists of two Python dictionaries.
* You can see it inside the [data.py](https://github.com/nuwandda/deep-learning-practices/blob/main/sentiment_analysis_with_RNN/data.py) file.

## Model
* A typical vanilla RNN uses only 3 sets of weights to perform its calculations.
* We have 2 biases.
* We are using 'many to one' RNN.
